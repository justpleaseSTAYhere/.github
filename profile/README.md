# StayHere

Let me tell you a bit about this project. It’s really similar to here.fm, it is a replacement. Currently we have the base of the website, the homepage. Currently we are working on the database, so that registerations and log ins are possible. After that we will get in online as a test, and when it works we’ll add a messenger. After that the ‘room’, where people can join with avatars. Last but not least, the profile editor. After that the website is ‘done’ we will only update because of bugs, stickers or something similar!! I’m glad that you are interested in this.
